### Hello world, this is LuÃ­s ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own OS write in Rust, because it would be fun to see if it runs on WASM on the web!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, SurrealDB, WASM and another things.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects

- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like this C++ Donut, it's the contemplation of the art of code
